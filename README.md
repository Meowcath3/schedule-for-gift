# schedule-for-gift
sooooooo... I made this cute schedule in pixelart, pefect idea for a super-busy couple. I used backend for the front with golang as a personal challenge but most tasks are actually defined by JS. I hope this is a good idea (and useful for those interested) and please, any feedback is very welcome for improving-purposes.
